# IMDB Profitable movie analysis

### Project Overview
This data analysis project was created to provide insights that will lead to a commercially successful movie. By analyzing  various aspects of this IMDB dataset, I'm seeking to find trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a better understanding of the path that leads to a profitable movie.

### Data Source
The dataset was created by 'Chidambara Raju G' from kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajugc/imdb-top-250-movies-dataset/data

### Tools
 - SQL Server
 - Tableau

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
- Make a copy of the dataset
- Standardizing the data
- Check for errors, outliers, and Inconsistencies
- check for blank values

### Exploratory Data analysis
Exploring the data to answer key questions such as:
- Which movies have the highest box office?
- Which movies have the best return on investment?
- What trends lead to a movie having high box office numbers?

### Data Analysis

```SQL
-- creating a new table to work on
create table movies
like `imdb top 250 movies`

insert movies
select * 
from `imdb top 250 movies`

--Creating a columnn that shows return on investment
alter table movies
add ROI int

update movies
set ROI = (box_office/budget) * 100

--Standardizing the data
update movies
set certificate = 'PG'
where certificate like '%gp%'

update movies
set certificate = 'R'
where certificate like '%13+%' or certificate like '%18+%' or certificate like 'unrated'

-- Some movies had money that needed to translate to dollars
select *
from movies
where roi <= 1

update movies 
set budget = 15749478
where name like '%Princess Mononoke%'

update movies 
set budget = 6570272
where name like '%3 Idiots%'

update movies 
set box_office = 31500000
where name like '%Barry Lyndon%'

--creating a row for movies with unusable data
alter table movies
add compromised nvarchar

update movies
set compromised = case
					when year < 1968 then 'compromised'
					when name = 'Dersu Uzala' then 'compromised'
					when name = 'Princess Mononoke' then 'compromised'
					when budget is null then 'compromised'
					when box_office is null then 'compromised'
						else 'good'
						end

```

### Results/Findings
- Genres categorized as "Adventure" average overall the highest box office numbers, followed by "Fantasy", "Family", "Action", and "animation. "Animation" averaged the highest budget and "Horror" has the highest ROI.
- Movies rated "PG-13" average the highest in box office numbers followed by rated "G". Movies rated "PG" had the highest ROI. There was only 1 movie rated "X".
- After a movie has a rating of 8 or above, there doesn't seem to be a difference in box office numbers.
- Between 1968 and 2022, movies categorized as "Adventure", "Action", "Drama", "Sci-Fi", and "Comedy" see a steady increase in box office numbers
- "Rocky", "Star Wars A New Hope", "Jaws", "A Separation", and "The Intouchables" have the highest ROI. Of the top 20 movies with the highest ROI, "Joker" has the Highest box office.

### Recommendations
- Aim for movies categorized as "adventure" with a "PG-13" for the highest box office probability.
- There is a risk with the adventure genre. It averages the third highest budget.
- If the budget is limited, the "horror" genre averages the lowest budget with the highest return on investment.
- Movies tagged with "adventure", "action", "drama", and "comedy" have a steady increase in box office numbers. Focusing on these tags should lead to a successful movie.

### Limitations
- I excluded movies before 1968 for budget and box office because the numbers weren't reliable.
- Some of the movies used international currency for box office and numbers. I updated the numbers to US currency when possible. If not, the data was excluded.
